This ``bookdown'' book contains teaching and learning materials prepared and used during ``Introduction to biostatistics and machine learning'' course organised by NBIS, National Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden. The course is open for PhD students, postdoctoral researcher and other employees in need of biostatistical skills within Swedish universities. The materials are geared towards life scientists wanting to be able to understand and use basic statistical and machine learning methods. It may also suits those already applying biostatistical methods but who have never gotten a chance to reflect on the basic statistical concepts, such as the commonly misinterpreted p-value.

\section{Variables, constants and letters}\label{variables-constants-and-letters}}

Mathematics gives us a precise language to communicate different concepts and ideas. To be able to use it it is essential to learn symbols and understand how they are used to represent physical quantities as well as understand the rules and conventions that have been developed to manipulate them.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{variables}: things that can vary, e.g.~temperature and time
\item
  \textbf{constants}: fixed and unchanging quantities used in certain calculations, e.g.~3.14159
\item
  in principle one could freely choose letters and symbols to represent variables and constants, but it is helpful and choose letters and symbols that have meaning in a particular context. Hence, we
\item
  \(x, y, z\), the end of the alphabet is reserved for variables
\item
  \(a, b, c\), the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent constants
\item
  \(\pi\), \(\omega\) and Greek letters below are used frequently used to represent common constant, e.g.~\(\pi = 3.14159\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{a-precise-language}{%
\section{A precise language}\label{a-precise-language}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mathematics is a precise language meaning that a special attention has to be paid to the exact position of any symbol in relation to other.
\item
  Given two symbols \(x\) and \(y\), \(xy\) and \(x^y\) and \(x_y\) can mean different things
\item
  \(xy\) stands for multiplication, \(x^y\) for superscript and \(x_y\) for subscript
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{using-symbols}{%
\section{Using symbols}\label{using-symbols}}

If the letters \(x\) and \(y\) represent two numbers, then:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  their \textbf{sum} is written as \(x + y\)
\item
  subtracting \(y\) from \(x\) is \(x - y\), known also as \textbf{difference}
\item
  to multiply \(x\) and \(y\) we written as \(x \cdot y\) or also with the multiplication signed omitted as \(xy\). The quantity is known as \textbf{product of x and y}
\item
  multiplication is \textbf{associative}, e.g.~when we multiply three numbers together, \(x \cdot y \cdot z\), the order of multiplication does not matter, so \(x \cdot y \cdot z\) is the same as \(z \cdot x \cdot y\) or \(y cdot z \cdot x\)
\item
  division is denoted by \(\frac{x}{y}\) and mans that \(x\) is divided by \(y\). In this expression \(x\), on the top, is called \textbf{numerator} and \(y\), on the bottom, is called \textbf{denominator}
\item
  division by 1 leaves any number unchanged, e.g.~\(\frac{x}{1}=x\) and division by 0 is not allowed
\end{itemize}

Equal sign

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the equal sign \(=\) is used in \textbf{equations}, e.g.~\(x - 5 = 0\) or \(5x = 1\)
\item
  the equal sign \(=\) can be also used in \textbf{formulae}. Physical quantities are related through a formula in many fields, e.g.~the formula \(A=\pi r^2\) relates circle area \(A\) to its radius \(r\) and the formula \(s = \frac{d}{t}\) defines speed as distance \(d\) divided by time \(t\)
\item
  the equal sign \(=\) is also used in identities, expressions true for all values of the variable, e.g.~\((x-1)(x-1) = (x^2-1)\)
\item
  opposite to the equal sign is ``is not equal to'' sign \(\neq\), e.g.~we can write \(1+2 \neq 4\)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Sigma and Product notation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the \(\Sigma\) notation, read as \textbf{Sigma notation}, provides a convenient way of writing longs sums, e.g.~the sum of \(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{20}\) is written as \(\sum_{i=1}^{i=20}x_i\)
\item
  the \(\Pi\) notation, read as \textbf{Product notation}, provides a convenient way of writing longs products, e.g.~\(x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot x_3 \cdot ... \cdot x_{20}\) is written as \(\prod_{i=1}^{i=20}x_i\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{inequalities}{%
\section{Inequalities}\label{inequalities}}

Given any two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) there are three mutually exclusive possibilities:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(a > b\), meaning that \(a\) is greater than \(b\)
\item
  \(a < b\), meaning that \(a\) is less than \(b\)
\item
  \(a = b\), meaning that \(a\) is equal to \(b\)
\end{itemize}

Strict and weak

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  inequality in \(a > b\) and \(a < b\) is \textbf{strict}
\item
  as oppose to \textbf{weak} inequality denoted as \(a \ge b\) or \(a \le b\)
\end{itemize}

Some useful relations are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if \(a > b\) and \(b > c\) then \(a > c\)
\item
  if \(a > b\) then \(a + c > b\) for any \(c\)
\item
  if \(a > b\) then \(ac > bc\) for any positive \(c\)
\item
  if \(a > b\) then \(ac < bc\) for any negative \(c\)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{indices-and-powers}{%
\section{Indices and powers}\label{indices-and-powers}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Indices}, also known as \textbf{powers} are convenient when we multiply a number by itself several times
\item
  e.g.~\(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5\) is written as \(5^3\) and \(4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4\) is written as \(4^5\)
\item
  in the expression \(x^y\), \(x\) is called the \emph{base} and \(y\) is called \emph{index} or \emph{power}
\end{itemize}

The laws of indices state:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(a^m \cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\)
\item
  \(\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\)
\item
  \((a^m)^n = a^{m\cdot n}\)
\end{itemize}

Rules derived from the laws of indices:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(a^0 = 1\)
\item
  \(a^1 = a\)
\end{itemize}

Negative and fractional indices:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}\) e.g.~\(5^{-2} = \frac{1}{5^2} = \frac{1}{25}\) for negative indices
\item
  e.g.~\(4^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{4}\) or \(8^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{8}\) for fractional indices
\end{itemize}

Exr. \ref{exr:m-notations-variables-constants}

\item
  variable, mass of an apple is a variable, different for different apple sizes, for instance 138 grams, denoted as \(m = 100 g\)
\item
  variable, like mass volume can be different from apple to apple, denoted as \(V\), e.g.~\(V = 200 cm^3\)
\item
  variable, like volume and mass can vary, denoted as \(\rho_i\) and defined as \(\rho_i=\frac{m}{V}\). So given 6.3 milligrams of vitamin C in our example apple, we have \(\rho_i=\frac{0.0063}{2}\frac{g}{cm^3} = 0.0000315 \frac{g}{cm^3}\) concentration of vitamin D
\item
  constant, the distance between Stockholm and Uppsala is fixed; it could be a variable though if we were to consider an experiment on a very long time scale; distance is often denoted in physics as \(d\)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{set}: a well-defined collection of distinct objects, e.g.~\(S = \{2, 4, 6\}\)
\item
  \textbf{elements}: the objects that make up the set are also known as \textbf{elements} of the set
\item
  if \(x\) is an element of \(S\), we say that \(x\) belongs to \(S\) and write \(x \in S\) and if \(x\) is not an element of \(S\) we say that \(x\) does not belong to \(S\) and write \(x \notin S\)
\item
  a set may contain \textbf{finitely} many or \textbf{infinitely} many elements
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{subset, \(\subseteq\)}: if every element of set A is also in B, then A is said to be a subset of B, written as \(A \subseteq B\) and pronounced A is contained in B, e.g.~\(A \subseteq B\), when \(A = \{2, 4, 6\}\) and \$ = \(B = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}\). Every set is a subset if itself.
\item
  \textbf{superset}: for our outs \(A\) and \(B\) we can also say that \(B\) is a \textbf{superset} of \(A\) and write \(B \supset A\)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{cardinality}: the number of elements within a set \(S\), denoted as \(|S|\)

\item
  \textbf{intersection of two sets, \(\cap\)}: a new set can be constructed by taking members of two sets that are ``in common'', written as \(A \cap B\), e.g.~\(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \cap \{2, 3, 7\} = \{2, 3\}\) or \(\{1, 2, 3\} \cap \{7 \} = \emptyset \}\)

  \textbf{complement of a set, \(A'\), \(A^c\)}: are the elements not in A
\item
  \textbf{difference of two sets, \(\setminus\)}: two sets can be ``substracted'', denoted by \(A \setminus B\), by taking all elements that are members of A but are not members of B, e.g.~\(\{1, 2, 3, 4\} \setminus \{1, 3\} = \{2, 4\}\). This is also in other words a relative complement of A with respect to B.

\item
  \textbf{partition of a set}: a partition of a set S is a set of nonempty subset of S, such that every element x in S is in exactly one of these subsets. That is, the subset are pairwise \emph{disjoint}, meaning no two sets of the partition contain elements in common, and the union of all the subset of the partition is S, e.g.~Set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) has five partitions: i) \(\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}\), ii) \(\{1, 2\}, \{3\}\), iii) \(\{1,3\}, \{2\}\), iv) \(\{1\}, \{2, 3\}\) and v) \(\{1,2,3\}\)

Venn diagram is a diagram that shows all possible logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. A Venn diagrams shows elements as points in the plane, and sets as regions inside closed curves.

\hypertarget{evaluating-function}{%
\section{Evaluating function}\label{evaluating-function}}

To evaluate a function is to replace (substitute) its variable with a given number or expression. E.g. given a rule (function) that maps temperature measurements from Celsius to Fahrenheit scale:
\[f(x) = 1.8x + 32\]
where \(x\) is temperature measurements in Celsius and \(f(x)\) is the associated value in Fahrenheit, we can find for a given temperature in Celsius corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit. Let's say we measure 10 Celsius degrees one autumn day in Uppsala and we want to share this information with a friend in USA. We can find the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit by evaluating our function at 10, \(f(10)\), giving us \[f(10) = 1.8\cdot 10 + 32 = 50\]

\hypertarget{plotting-function}{%
\section{Plotting function}\label{plotting-function}}

Function graphs are a convenient way of showing functions, by looking at the graph it is easier to notice function's properties, e.g.~for which input values functions yields positive outcomes or whether the function is increasing or decreasing. To graph a function, one can start by evaluating function at different values for the argument \(x\) obtaining \(f(x)\), plotting the points by plotting the pairs \((x, f(x))\) and connecting the dots. E.g. evaluating our above temperature rule at -20, -10, 0, 10, 20, 30 Celsius degrees results in:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
x (Celsius degrees) & evaluates & f(x) (Farenheit degress)\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
-20 & \(f(-20) = 1.8 \cdot (-20) + 32\) & -4\tabularnewline
-10 & \(f(-20) = 1.8 \cdot (-10) + 32\) & 14\tabularnewline
0 & \(f(-20) = 1.8 \cdot (0) + 32\) & 32\tabularnewline
10 & \(f(-20) = 1.8 \cdot (10) + 32\) & 50\tabularnewline
20 & \(f(-20) = 1.8 \cdot (20) + 32\) & 68\tabularnewline

\hypertarget{piecewise-functions}{%
\section{Piecewise functions}\label{piecewise-functions}}

A function can be in pieces, i.e.~we can create functions that behave differently based on the input \(x\) value. They are useful to describe situations in w which a rule changes as the input value crosses certain ``boundaries''. E.g. a function value could be fixed in a given range and equal to the input value (identify function) for input values outside this range

\begin{equation}
    f(x) =
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}
                2 & \mathrm{if\ } x \le 1 \\
                x & \mathrm{if\ } x>1 \\
        \end{array}
    \right.
\end{equation}

The function can be split in many pieces, e.g.~the personal training fee in SEK may depend whether the personal trainer is hired for an hour, two hours or three or more hours:
\begin{equation}
    f(h) =
    \left\{
        \begin{array}{cc}
                500  & \mathrm{if\ } h \le 1 \\
                750  & \mathrm{if\ } 1 < h \le 2 \\
                500 + 250 \cdot h & \mathrm{if\ } h > 2 \\
        \end{array}
    \right.

\end{figure}

To dive further into calculating the rate of change let's look at Figure \ref{fig:diff-01} and define the \emph{average rate of change} of a function across an interval. Figure \ref{fig:diff-01} shows a function \(f(x)\) with two possible argument values \(a\) and \(b\) marked and their corresponding function values \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\).

Consider that \(x\) is increasing from \(a\) to \(b\). The change in \(x\) is \(b-a\), i.e.~as \(x\) increases from \(a\) to \(b\) the function \(f(x)\) increase from \(f(a)\) to \(f(b)\). The change in \(f(x)\) is \(f(b)-f(a)\) and the average rate of change of \(y\) across the \([a,b]\) interval is:

\begin{equation}
\frac{change\:in\:y}{change\:in\:x}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}
\label{eq:diff-point}
\end{equation}

E.g. let's take a quadratic function \(f(x)=x^2\) and calculate the average rate of change across the interval \([1, 4]\).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The change in \(x\) is \(4-1\) and the change in \(f(x)\) is \(f(4) - f(1) = 4^2 -1^2 = 16 - 1 = 15\). So the average rate of change is \(\frac{15}{3}=5\). What does this mean? It means that across the interval \([1,4]\) on average the \(f(x)\) value increases by 5 for every 1 unit increase in \(x\).
\item
  If we were to look at the average rate of change across the interval \([-2, 0]\) we would get \(\frac{f(-2)-f(1)}{-2 - 0}=\frac{-2^2-0}{-2-0}=\frac{4}{-2} = -2\). Here, over the \([-2, 0]\) on average the \(f(x)\) value decreases by 2 for every 1 unit increase in \(x\).
\item
  Looking at the graph of \(f(x)=x^2\) verifies our calculations
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{104-math-differentiation_files/figure-latex/diff-avg-rate-1}

\caption{Example function $f(x) = x^2$}\label{fig:diff-avg-rate}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{rate-of-change-at-a-point}{%
\section{Rate of change at a point}\label{rate-of-change-at-a-point}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We often need to know the rate of change of a function at a point, and not simply an average rate of change across an interval.
\item
  Figure \ref{fig:diff-02}, similar to Figure \ref{fig:diff-01}, shows, instead of two points \(a\) and \(b\), point \(a\) and a second point defined in terms of its distance from the first point \(a\). Thus, the two points are now \(a\) and \(a + h\) and the distance between the two points is equal to \(h\).
\item
  Now we can write that:
  \[\frac{change\:in\:y}{change\:in\:x}=\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{a+h-a} = \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\]
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{figures/precourse/math-differentiation-02} 

}

\caption{The average rate of change of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ over $[a, b]$ is equal to the slope of the secant line (in black)}\label{fig:diff-02}
\end{figure}

Further:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if we assume that the second point \(a+h\) is really close to \(a\), meaning that \(h\) approaches 0, denoted as \(h \rightarrow 0\), we can find the rate of change at the point \(a\)
\item
  the distance between the two points \(a\) and \(a+h\) is getting smaller and so is the difference of the function values \(f(a+h) - f(a)\). We denote these small differences as \(\delta a\) and \(\delta f(x) = \delta(y)\) respectively
\item
  the term \(\delta\) reads as ``delta'' and represents a small change
\end{itemize}

We can thus continue and write that a \textbf{rate of change of a function at a point} is given by
\begin{equation}
\frac{small\:change\:in\:y}{small\:change\:in\:x} = \lim_{x\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
\label{eq:diff-point}
\end{equation}

E.g. let's look at the linear function \(f(x) = 2x+3\). We can find the rate of change at any point of a function by:
\[\frac{small\:change\:in\:y}{small\:change\:in\:x} = \lim_{x\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} = \\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}= \lim_{x\to0}\frac{2(x+h)+3-(2x+3)}{x+h-x}=\lim_{x\to0}\frac{2h}{h}=2\]
It mean that the \(f(x)\) value increases by 2 for every small increase, \(h\), in \(x\). This increase is the same for all the values of \(x\), does not depend on \(x\). It could be the case, for instance if we look at the quadratic \(f(x)=x^2\) function, we get:
\[\frac{small\:change\:in\:y}{small\:change\:in\:x} = \lim_{x\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} =\\ \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}=\lim_{x\to0}\frac{x^2+2xh+h^2-x^2}{h}=\lim_{x\to0}\frac{2xh+h^2}{h}=2x+h\]
This means that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the rate of change for the function \(f(x)\) at a point \(x\) is \(2x\)
\item
  the \(f(x)\) value increases by \(2x\) for every small increase, \(h\), in \(x\)
\item
  the rate of change along a quadratic function is changing constantly according to the value of \(x\) we are looking at, it is a function of \(x\)
\item
  and finally that the rate of change does not give us any information about the rate of change globally.
\end{itemize}

The outcome of a random experiment can be described by a \emph{random variable}.

Whenever chance is involved in the outcome of an experiment the outcome is a random variable.

A random variable can not be predicted exactly, but the probability of all possible outcomes can be described.

A random variable is usually denoted by a capital letter, \(X, Y, Z, \dots\). Values collected in an experiment are \emph{observations} of the random variable, usually denoted by lowercase letters \(x, y, z, \dots\).

The \emph{population} is the collection of all possible observations of the random variable. Note, the population is not always countable.

A \emph{sample} is a subset of the population.

Example random variables:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The weight of a random newborn baby
\item
  The smoking status of a random mother
\item
  The hemoglobin concentration in blood
\item
  The number of mutations in a gene
\item
  BMI of a random man
\item
  Weight status of a random man (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese)
\item
  The result of throwing a die
\end{itemize}

Some things are more likely to occur than others. Compare:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the chance of the sun rising tomorrow with the chance that no-one is infected with COVID-19 tomorrow
\item
  the chance of a cold dark winter in Stockholm with the chance of no rainy days over the summer months in Stockholm
\end{itemize}

We intuitively believe that the chance of sun rising or dark winter occurring are enormously higher than COVID-19 disappearing over night or having no rain over the entire summer. \textbf{Probability} gives us a scale for measuring the likeliness of events to occur. \textbf{Probability rules} enable us to reason about uncertain events. The probability rules are expressed in terms of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)}{sets}, a well-defined collection of distinct objects.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{set}: a well-defined collection of distinct objects, e.g.~\(A = \{2, 4, 6\}\)
\item
  \textbf{subset, \(\subseteq\)}: if every element of set A is also in B, then A is said to be a subset of B, written as \(A \subseteq B\) and pronounced A is contained in B, e.g.~\(A \subseteq B\), when \(B = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}\). Every set is a subset if itself.
\item
  \textbf{empty set, \(\emptyset\)}: is a unique set with no members, denoted by \(E = \emptyset\) or \(E = \{\}\). The empty set is a subset of very set.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{basic-set-operations}{%
\section{Basic set operations}\label{basic-set-operations}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{union of two sets, \(\cup\) }: two sets can be ``added'' together, the union of A and B, written as \(A \cup B\), e.g.~\(\{1, 2\} \cup \{2, 3\} = \{1, 2, 3\}\) or \(\{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{1, 4, 5, 6\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\)
\item
  \textbf{intersection of two sets, \(\cap\)}: a new set can be constructed by taking members of two sets that are ``in common'', written as \(A \cap B\), e.g.~\(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \cap \{2, 3, 7\} = \{2, 3\}\) or \(\{1, 2, 3\} \cap \{7 \} = \emptyset \}\)
\item
  \textbf{complement of a set, \(A´\), \(A^C\)}: are the elements not in A
\item
  \textbf{difference of two sets, \(\setminus\)}: two sets can be ``substracted'', denoted by \(A \setminus B\), by taking all elements that are members of A but are not members of B, e.g.~\(\{1, 2, 3, 4\} \setminus \{1, 3\} = \{2, 4\}\). This is also in other words a relative complement of A with respect to B.
\item
  \textbf{partition of a set}: a partition of a set S is a set of nonempty subset of S, such that every element x in S is in exactly one of these subsets. That is, the subset are pairwise \emph{disjoint}, meaning no two sets of the partition cotain elements in common, and the union of all the subset of the partition is S, e.g.~Set \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) has five partitions: i) \(\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}\), ii) \(\{1, 2\}, \{3\}\), iii) \(\{1,3\}, \{2\}\), iv) \(\{1\}, \{2, 3\}\) and v) \(\{1,2,3\}\)
