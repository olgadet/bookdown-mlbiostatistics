**Aims**

**Learning outcomes**

- understand the concept of random variables and probability
- use resampling to compute probabilities

## Random variables

The outcome of a random experiment can be described by a *random variable*.

Whenever chance is involved in the outcome of an experiment the outcome is a random variable.

A random variable can not be predicted exactly, but the probability of all possible outcomes can be described.

A random variable is usually denoted by a capital letter, $X, Y, Z, \dots$. Values collected in an experiment are *observations* of the random variable, usually denoted by lowercase letters $x, y, z, \dots$.

The *population* is the collection of all possible observations of the random variable. Note, the population is not always countable.

A *sample* is a subset of the population.

Example random variables:

- The weight of a random newborn baby
- The smoking status of a random mother
- The hemoglobin concentration in blood
- The number of mutations in a gene
- BMI of a random man
- Weight status of a random man (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese)
- The result of throwing a die
