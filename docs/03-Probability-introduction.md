# Probability: reasoning under uncertainty

**Learning outcomes**

- understand the concept of probability
- manipulate probabilites by their rules
- assign probabilities in very simple cases


## Introduction

Some things are more likely to occur than others. Compare:

- the chance of the sun rising tomorrow with the chance that no-one is infected with COVID-19 tomorrow
- the chance of a cold dark winter in Stockholm with the chance of no rainy days over the summer months in Stockholm

We intuitively believe that the chance of sun rising or dark winter occurring are enormously higher than COVID-19 disappearing over night or having no rain over the entire summer. **Probability** gives us a scale for measuring the likeliness of events to occur. **Probability rules** enable us to reason about uncertain events. The probability rules are expressed in terms of [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)), a well-defined collection of distinct objects.
