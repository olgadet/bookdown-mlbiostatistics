The course is open for PhD students, postdoctoral researcher and other employees in need of biostatistical skills within Swedish universities. The course is geared towards life scientists wanting to be able to understand and use basic statistical and machine learning methods. It also suits those already applying biostatistical methods but who have never gotten a chance to reflect on or truly grasp the basic statistical concepts, such as the commonly misinterpreted p-value.
