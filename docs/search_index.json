The course is open for PhD students, postdoctoral researcher and other employees in need of biostatistical skills within Swedish universities. The materials are geared towards life scientists wanting to be able to understand and use basic statistical and machine learning methods. It may also suits those already applying biostatistical methods but who have never gotten a chance to reflect on the basic statistical concepts, such as the commonly misinterpreted p-value.

To be able to use it it is essential to learn symbols and understand how they are used to represent physical quantities as well as understand the rules and conventions that have been developed to manipulate them. variables: things that can vary, e.g. temperature and time constants: fixed and unchanging quantities used in certain calculations, e.g. 3.14159 in principle one could freely choose letters and symbols to represent variables and constants, but it is helpful and choose letters and symbols that have meaning in a particular context. Hence, we \\(x, y, z\\), the end of the alphabet is reserved for variables \\(a, b, c\\), the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent constants \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\omega\\) and Greek letters below are used frequently used to represent common constant, e.g. \\(\\pi = 3.14159\\) Table 1.1: Uppercase and lowercase letters of the Greek alphabet Letter Upper case Lower case Letter Upper case Lower case Alpha A \\(\\alpha\\) Nu N \\(\\nu\\) Beta B \\(\\beta\\) Xi \\(\\Xi\\) \\(\\xi\\) Gamma \\(\\Gamma\\) \\(\\gamma\\) Omicron O o Delta \\(\\Delta\\) \\(\\delta\\) Pi \\(\\Pi\\) \\(\\pi\\) Epsilon E \\(\\epsilon\\) Rho P \\(\\rho\\) Zeta Z \\(\\zeta\\) Sigma \\(\\Sigma\\) \\(\\sigma\\) Eta H \\(\\eta\\) Tau T \\(\\tau\\) Theta \\(\\Theta\\) \\(\\theta\\) Upsilon Y \\(\\upsilon\\) Iota i \\(\\iota\\) Phi \\(\\Phi\\) \\(\\phi\\) Kappa K \\(\\kappa\\) Chi \\(\\Gamma\\) \\(\\gamma\\) Lambda \\(\\Gamma\\) \\(\\gamma\\) Psi \\(\\Psi\\) \\(\\psi\\) Mu M \\(\\mu\\) Omega \\(\\Omega\\) \\(\\omega\\) 1.3 A precise language Mathematics is a precise language meaning that a special attention has to be paid to the exact position of any symbol in relation to other. Given two symbols \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), \\(xy\\) and \\(x^y\\) and \\(x_y\\) can mean different things \\(xy\\) stands for multiplication, \\(x^y\\) for superscript and \\(x_y\\) for subscript 1.4 Using symbols If the letters \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) represent two numbers, then: their sum is written as \\(x + y\\) subtracting \\(y\\) from \\(x\\) is \\(x - y\\), known also as difference to multiply \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) we written as \\(x \\cdot y\\) or also with the multiplication signed omitted as \\(xy\\). The quantity is known as product of x and y multiplication is associative, e.g. when we multiply three numbers together, \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot z\\), the order of multiplication does not matter, so \\(x \\cdot y \\cdot z\\) is the same as \\(z \\cdot x \\cdot y\\) or \\(y cdot z \\cdot x\\) division is denoted by \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\) and mans that \\(x\\) is divided by \\(y\\). In this expression \\(x\\), on the top, is called numerator and \\(y\\), on the bottom, is called denominator division by 1 leaves any number unchanged, e.g. \\(\\frac{x}{1}=x\\) and division by 0 is not allowed Equal sign the equal sign \\(=\\) is used in equations, e.g. \\(x - 5 = 0\\) or \\(5x = 1\\) the equal sign \\(=\\) can be also used in formulae. Physical quantities are related through a formula in many fields, e.g. the formula \\(A=\\pi r^2\\) relates circle area \\(A\\) to its radius \\(r\\) and the formula \\(s = \\frac{d}{t}\\) defines speed as distance \\(d\\) divided by time \\(t\\) the equal sign \\(=\\) is also used in identities, expressions true for all values of the variable, e.g. \\((x-1)(x-1) = (x^2-1)\\) opposite to the equal sign is “is not equal to” sign \\(\\neq\\), e.g. we can write \\(1+2 \\neq 4\\) Sigma and Product notation the \\(\\Sigma\\) notation, read as Sigma notation, provides a convenient way of writing longs sums, e.g. the sum of \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... + x_{20}\\) is written as \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{i=20}x_i\\) the \\(\\Pi\\) notation, read as Product notation, provides a convenient way of writing longs products, e.g. \\(x_1 \\cdot x_2 \\cdot x_3 \\cdot ... \\cdot x_{20}\\) is written as \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{i=20}x_i\\) 1.5 Inequalities Given any two real numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) there are three mutually exclusive possibilities: \\(a &gt; b\\), meaning that \\(a\\) is greater than \\(b\\) \\(a &lt; b\\), meaning that \\(a\\) is less than \\(b\\) \\(a = b\\), meaning that \\(a\\) is equal to \\(b\\) Strict and weak inequality in \\(a &gt; b\\) and \\(a &lt; b\\) is strict as oppose to weak inequality denoted as \\(a \\ge b\\) or \\(a \\le b\\) Some useful relations are: if \\(a &gt; b\\) and \\(b &gt; c\\) then \\(a &gt; c\\) if \\(a &gt; b\\) then \\(a + c &gt; b\\) for any \\(c\\) if \\(a &gt; b\\) then \\(ac &gt; bc\\) for any positive \\(c\\) if \\(a &gt; b\\) then \\(ac &lt; bc\\) for any negative \\(c\\) 1.6 Indices and powers Indices, also known as powers are convenient when we multiply a number by itself several times e.g. \\(5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5\\) is written as \\(5^3\\) and \\(4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 4\\) is written as \\(4^5\\) in the expression \\(x^y\\), \\(x\\) is called the base and \\(y\\) is called index or power The laws of indices state: \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\) \\(\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\\) \\((a^m)^n = a^{m\\cdot n}\\) Rules derived from the laws of indices: \\(a^0 = 1\\) \\(a^1 = a\\) Negative and fractional indices: \\(a^{-m} = \\frac{1}{a^m}\\) e.g. \\(5^{-2} = \\frac{1}{5^2} = \\frac{1}{25}\\) for negative indices e.g. \\(4^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{4}\\) or \\(8^{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\sqrt[3]{8}\\) for fractional indices 1.7 Excercises: notations Exercise 1.1 Classify numbers as natural, integers or real. If reall, specify if they are rational or irrational. \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) 2 \\(\\sqrt{4}\\) 2.3 \\(\\pi\\) \\(\\sqrt{5}\\) -7 0 0.25 Exercise 1.2 Classify below descriptors as variables or constants.

So given 6.3 milligrams of vitamin C in our example apple, we have \\(\\rho_i=\\frac{0.0063}{2}\\frac{g}{cm^3} = 0.0000315 \\frac{g}{cm^3}\\) concentration of vitamin D constant, the distance between Stockholm and Uppsala is fixed; it could be a variable though if we were to consider an experiment on a very long time scale; distance is often denoted in physics as \\(d\\) variable, time on the train to travel between the stations varies, often denoted as \\(t\\) with speed being calculated as \\(s = \\frac{d}{t}\\) constant, electron charge is \\(e = 1.60217663\\cdot10^{-19} C\\) Exr. 1.3 \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{i=6}k_i = k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 + k_5 + k_6\\) \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{i=6}k_i = k_1 \\cdot k_2 \\cdot k_3 \\cdot k_4 \\cdot k_5 \\cdot k_6\\) \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{i=3}i^k = 1^k + 2^k + 3^k\\) \\(\\prod_{i=1}^{i=3}i^k = 1^k \\cdot 2^k \\cdot 3^k\\) \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}i = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\\) we are using dots (…) to represent all the number until \\(n\\).

Common terms worth knowing: 3.2 Evaluating function To evaluate a function is to replace (substitute) its variable with a given number or expression. E.g. given a rule (function) that maps temperature measurements from Celsius to Fahrenheit scale: \\[f(x) = 1.8x + 32\\] where \\(x\\) is temperature measurements in Celsius and \\(f(x)\\) is the associated value in Fahrenheit, we can find for a given temperature in Celsius corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit. Let’s say we measure 10 Celsius degrees one autumn day in Uppsala and we want to share this information with a friend in USA. We can find the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit by evaluating our function at 10, \\(f(10)\\), giving us \\[f(10) = 1.8\\cdot 10 + 32 = 50\\] 3.3 Plotting function Function graphs are a convenient way of showing functions, by looking at the graph it is easier to notice function’s properties, e.g. for which input values functions yields positive outcomes or whether the function is increasing or decreasing. To graph a function, one can start by evaluating function at different values for the argument \\(x\\) obtaining \\(f(x)\\), plotting the points by plotting the pairs \\((x, f(x))\\) and connecting the dots.

Compare: the chance of the sun rising tomorrow with the chance that no-one is infected with COVID-19 tomorrow the chance of a cold dark winter in Stockholm with the chance of no rainy days over the summer months in Stockholm We intuitively believe that the chance of sun rising or dark winter occurring are enormously higher than COVID-19 disappearing over night or having no rain over the entire summer.

Example random variables: The weight of a random newborn baby The smoking status of a random mother The hemoglobin concentration in blood The number of mutations in a gene BMI of a random man Weight status of a random man (underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese) The result of throwing a die Whenever chance is involved in the outcome of an experiment the outcome is a random variable.
